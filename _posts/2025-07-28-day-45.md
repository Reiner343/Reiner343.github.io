what_i_learned: |
  Today, I deepened my understanding of how sensor data can be calibrated and transmitted in real time using Arduino and Firebase. I learned how to structure the data so it could be stored properly and later used for machine learning analysis. Working with Firebase helped me see how cloud platforms make it easier to collect, store, and monitor environmental data remotely. I also spent time reviewing our machine learning model to ensure it aligns with the data we're feeding in from the Arduino. Every step brought me closer to seeing how raw sensor data turns into actionable insights.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  It was rewarding to see the progress we’ve made with connecting the hardware and software sides of our project. There were moments of trial and error—especially when debugging the Arduino code—but that’s what made the small wins so satisfying. It’s one thing to understand how systems should work, and another to watch it all come to life. This experience continues to show me how powerful tech can be when all the moving parts finally sync. I’m looking forward to pushing it further and seeing what our model learns from the data we’ve worked so hard to gather.
