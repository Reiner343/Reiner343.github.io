what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about connecting, sharing ideas, and starting to look ahead. I kicked off with a fun cohort connect session where I and my team pitched my project in a low-key way and had the other interns guess what I was working on—it was a creative way to test how clearly I could explain it. Later, I met the high school teachers I’ll be working with for the rest of the summer, introduced myself, and gave them a rundown of my project. It was interesting to think about how to explain a technical concept in a way that makes sense to someone from a different background. I also made good progress on my machine learning course on Kaggle and started brainstorming presentation ideas with my team for next week’s symposium.
   
blockers: |
  No major blockers today, though simplifying my project explanation for new audiences took some effort because we were not allowed to use key words included in the project name. 
  
reflection: |
  Brainstorming for the upcoming symposium really helped me and my team get more organized. We spent time analyzing the different components of our potential device and started to break down which parts each of us would focus on moving forward. It made the project feel more real and gave us a clearer sense of direction. I’m feeling more confident about my role and excited to start building out my part of the work.
