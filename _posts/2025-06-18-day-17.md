what_i_learned: |
  Today, I and my teammate worked on an activity where we pictched UniV3rse, a social networking app built specifically for college students. The pitch focused on solving three main problems students face: struggling to make friends, not knowing who’s in their classes, and missing out on campus events. Through features like a classmate finder, swipe-to-connect friend matching, and a real-time event discovery feed, UniV3rse helps students find community from day one. While preparing the pitch, I learned how to clearly define the problem, showcase the app’s value, and lay out a realistic growth strategy that could take the product from five universities to over a hundred.

  I also realized how important it is to design tech that reflects real student experiences—not just to solve problems, but to help people truly feel like they belong.

  There were no blockers today.
  
reflection: |
  Working on the pitch helped me think beyond just the technical side of building an app. It made me consider things like how students actually interact on campus, what kinds of relationships they’re looking for, and why so many still feel disconnected even with tons of apps available. Crafting a solution that speaks directly to that felt empowering. I can now see how something like UniV3rse can not only fill a gap but change the way students experience college life altogether
