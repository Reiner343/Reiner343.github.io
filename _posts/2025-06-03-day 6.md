what_i_learned: |
  Today, I started with a fun trivia activity with my project team where our faculty mentor asked us random questions and facts. Then, I was lectured on the basics of citation, references and writing your research paper in the standard MLA format. After whcih, I started working on the summary of my literature review for the smart water project. Basically, the paper introduces the growing need for clean and pure water within our environment today. It places focus on the presence of pathogenic microbes and organisms within the water, which is the main concern particularly linked with various diseases caused by the infected water.  
  
  The study introduces a smart water pollution detection system that uses artificial intelligence and a multispectral sensor to continuously monitor and assess the quality of the water. The AS7265x multispectral sensor, which records light at visible, ultraviolet, and near-infrared wavelengths, is used in this configuration to identify variations in the composition of the water. I and my team also designed a logo and came up with a name for our product which is O.A.S.I.S.

  There were no blockers today. 

reflection: |
  The summary of the literature review gave me a deeper understanding of how to lay a solid foundation for my project. The study conducted showed that the system was highly precise and demonstrates how this type of technology could be useful for safeguarding the environment and public health. It also highlighted the need for additional testing on various types of water and in other locations.
