what_i_learned: |
  Today, I had the in-person kick-off where all the interns, faculty and graduate mentors introduced themselves in the auditorium. I also engaged in a discussion on generative AI and the world today. Here, Michael also gave an in-depth overview of the summer program with all the necessary information included. After which, I participated in a workshop with Mrs. Walters where we discussed independent and dependent variable mainly focusing on how to formulate ypur research and train data. Also, we took group pictures in the lobby of the auditorium. After this, I participated in a very fun group activity with my project team where we built a structure with spaghetti sticks and marshmallow. Next up, I had lunch with my project team. Lastly, I and my project team took a tour of our research labs and the building as a whole. 

  At my research lab, I reviewed my task for the week which is a literature review on AI fo water contamination detection. This helped me gain a better understanding of the contents and context of water contaminants as well as figuring out the AI tools for detecting water contamination.

  There were no blockers today. 

reflection: |
 Seeing all the interns, my faculty and graduate mentor today was really nice. I got to interact with them more and learn more about them on a personal level. The literature review helped me gain more understanding of my tasks I will be working on this summer. Next, I will be doing a brief summary of peer reviewed articles that are related to my smart water project.
