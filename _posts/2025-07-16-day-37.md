what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to analyze water sensor data and identify different types of patterns in it, like how pH changes slightly during the day and how turbidity levels rise during rainy seasons. I now understand how to transform and engineer new features like pH deviation, log turbidity, and water quality index to help the machine learning model perform better. I also explored how to deal with imbalanced class distributions when labeling water samples. Seeing how small changes in features like temperature or TDS can influence water safety helped me connect the data to real-world outcomes. This step gave me a deeper appreciation for the role of good data preparation before model training.

reflection: |
  Spending time with the data helped me realize that not all insights come from just training a model—some of the most important discoveries happen during the exploration phase. I’m proud of how I was able to break the complex data into smaller, understandable pieces. It made me more confident in using tools like log transformations and normalization. This process also reminded me how important context is—knowing why turbidity increases at certain times made the numbers feel more real. I'm excited to keep refining the features and seeing how they improve our final model.
