what_i_learned: |
  Today was a busy but productive day. I started off with a very insightful workshop on Research-based Writing Fundamentals, where I learned how to properly plan and structure a research paper from start to finish. The session helped me understand the importance of outlining ideas early and breaking the writing process into manageable stages like the introduction, methodology, and discussion.

  Afterward, I continued hands-on work with both hardware and machine learning tasks. On the hardware side, I successfully set up the Arduino with all three water quality sensors connected, and configured my Firebase database to have the right structure for real-time logging. I also began collecting my initial dataset — aiming for at least 1000 samples to train the model more effectively.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how important it is to build a strong foundation before diving deeper into technical work. The research writing workshop gave me clarity on how to communicate my findings in a more structured and professional way. Setting up both the sensors and Firebase required patience, but seeing data flow in real time made the effort worth it. On the machine learning side, I realized how crucial preprocessing and feature engineering are to the model’s success. Overall, I feel more confident in both the hardware and research aspects of this project.
