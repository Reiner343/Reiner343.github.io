what_i_learned: |
  Today, I took a tour around Morgan's State campus along with other interns. Here, I learned some facts about morgan like the school is 150 years old, there are two engineering buildings in the school. Also, I learned that they just newly started their medical school and the building is currently being constructed. After which, I started working on my presentation slide for my project video presetation where I gave a run down of my accomplishments as well as the challenges.
  
   Also, I started practicing my script for my project video to familiarize myself with the content of my slides.

  Today, there were no blockers. 

reflection: |
  The campus tour was interesting although it was really hot outside. Also, I got to learn a lot of facts about morgan state university as well as see all their academic buildings together with the faculty buildings. Working on my project video presentation slide was easier considering the fact I had all the necessary information stored in my daily blog posts. I am looking forward to recording the video with my team tomorrow.
