what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued studying our machine learning code, especially focusing on how it works on cleaning our water quality dataset. I'm starting to better understand how each line contributes to training the model and making predictions. Later in the day, we had a class session that walked us through the structure of a solid research paper. I learned about key parts like the introduction, methodology, and how to properly cite sources using references. It gave me a clearer picture of how to organize my thoughts and findings when it’s time to document our project.

  I also began thinking about how to clearly explain our model's purpose and impact in the research paper, especially for people who may not have a technical background. Combining both the technical training and writing elements today helped me connect the dots between building the model and effectively communicating its value.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Today was all about laying the groundwork—both in terms of data and writing. Cleaning the dataset showed me how important it is to prepare our inputs properly before doing anything with machine learning. At the same time, the research class helped me realize how every step of our process can be clearly explained to others through writing. I’m learning to be more patient with the technical details and to trust the process of building a solid research foundation.
