what_i_learned: |
  I learned how to generate and use Firebase credentials like the database secret and web API key, which are essential for authenticating the device. Updating the ESP32 code with my actual Wi-Fi credentials and Firebase values helped me understand how cloud platforms and IoT devices communicate. Running the code in the Arduino IDE and viewing output through the Serial Monitor was satisfying, especially once I saw confirmation that the device was successfully connected and transmitting data. It was a great way to connect backend setup with actual physical feedback from our hardware.

  I also learned how important precise formatting and correct placement of credentials are when working with microcontrollers and cloud databases, as even small mistakes can break the connection.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Today’s work helped solidify how all the pieces of our system connect—hardware, software, and cloud. I now have a better understanding of how Firebase receives sensor data and how to verify it step-by-step. Even though there were a few technical hiccups, this hands-on approach made everything more real and easier to grasp. Each test on the Serial Monitor brought us closer to our goal. I’m excited to build on this and start displaying the data on a dashboard soon.
