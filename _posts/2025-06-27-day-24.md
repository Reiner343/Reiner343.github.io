what_i_learned: |
  Today I spent some time reviewing the model I trained yesterday, especially focusing on the metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to better understand what parts of the model were strong and where it still needs improvement. I also explored how tweaking parameters in the Random Forest algorithm—like the number of estimators—can impact accuracy. It helped me see that machine learning isn’t just about running code once; it’s about continuously testing and refining until the results actually make sense.

  I also started comparing different classification models just to see how they perform on the same dataset. It was interesting to notice how even small changes in the model or data can lead to very different outcomes in predictions.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Even though today was a slower-paced workday, it gave me a chance to dive deeper into understanding how model performance is judged beyond just accuracy. I started thinking about how the model might behave with different or larger datasets and how it could be improved to make better predictions in a real-world setting. This was a good reminder that small adjustments can lead to more reliable results over time. It felt good to build on what I learned yesterday, and I’m starting to feel more confident in explaining my process to others.
