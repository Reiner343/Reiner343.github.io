what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about really understanding the machine learning code we’ve been using for our water quality project. I went back through each section, line by line, to figure out how everything fits together—from importing libraries and preprocessing the dataset, to training and testing the model. I also compared different parts of the model to see how changes could affect accuracy and prediction results. I got a clearer picture of how the decision tree model actually makes its predictions based on the sensor data. I also learned how splitting the dataset into training and testing sets helps the model generalize better, and not just memorize the data.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Today reminded me how important it is to not just run the code, but to truly understand what each part is doing. Taking the time to break things down helped me feel more confident about our project and prepared me to explain it clearly to others. It also made me realize that small changes in the model setup can make a big difference in the results. I still have a few areas I want to dive deeper into, like understanding feature importance and how to better tune hyperparameters. Overall, it was a productive day of learning and building more trust in the model we’re working with.
