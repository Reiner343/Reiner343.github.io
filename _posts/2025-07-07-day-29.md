what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about polishing up our mid-summer presentation materials. I focused on finishing my personal contribution slide for the group project and making sure the overall deck looked cohesive and clear. We also worked on our demo video, walking through our smart water monitoring system to make sure everything flowed smoothly and was easy to follow. It took a few retakes, but we really wanted it to reflect all the progress we've made so far. I also learned how to simplify technical terms and structure my slides in a way that keeps the audience engaged while still getting the key points across.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Preparing for the presentation really gave me a chance to step back and look at how much we've accomplished so far. It reminded me that being able to communicate technical work clearly is just as important as building the project itself. I had to think about how to explain complex steps like Firebase integration and model training in a way that makes sense to someone outside our group. Overall, I feel more confident about speaking on our progress and sharing our journey with others.
