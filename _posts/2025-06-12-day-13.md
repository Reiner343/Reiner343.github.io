what_i_learned: |
  Today was more about team bonding and reflection. We started with the Taboo game, which turned out to be such a fun way to connect with the other interns,it definitely got us thinking on our feet. After that, we played Jenga, and it brought out everyone’s playful side. Later on, my team and I reviewed all the progress we made during the week and started preparing what we’ll include in our slides for tomorrow’s project video. It felt good to take a step back and see how far we’ve come.
  
   It also helped me see how important collaboration is when it comes to pulling ideas together clearly and efficiently.

  I did run into a small challenge during the Taboo game, it was harder than I expected to describe certain words without using the obvious ones. I found myself stumbling a bit and struggling to get my point across to the team. 

reflection: |
  It was really helpful to pause and reflect as a team. Looking over everything we accomplished this week reminded me how much we’ve all grown, both individually and together. Communicating our ideas out loud made everything feel more real and cohesive. I'm excited to see how everything will come together in the final video.
