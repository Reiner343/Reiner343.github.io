what_i_learned: |
  Today, I really focused on understanding how Arduino code actually controls the components in our water monitoring setup. I and my team walked through the code line by line, and it was helpful to see how the sensor readings—like pH, turbidity, and temperature—get turned into actions, like switching on a fan or heater. I also learned how analog inputs work and how those values are converted into something we can read and use. Seeing all the data show up on the LCD in real time made it feel like we were building something truly useful.
  
   I also realized how powerful even simple code can be when it’s connected to real-world sensors and devices.

reflection: |
  At first, the code looked kind of intimidating, but once we slowed down and talked through it, everything started to click. I used to wonder how the sensors actually "talk" to the components, but now I see how the logic makes that happen. It’s cool how the system reacts to different readings like turning on the fan if the water’s too hot or the pH is off. This made me feel like we're building something with real-world impact, not just running a simulation.
