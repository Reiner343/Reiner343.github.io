what_i_learned: |
  Today, I completed a pre-survey form where I was asked different questions related to my reason for choosing CEAMLS AI Research Institute. After which, I attended the python 101 class where we covered topics like conditions in algorithm, boolean data types, and the 3 logical operators in python. Also, I engaged in an introduction to generative AI and LLMS class where I gained understanding of how AI learns from data to make predictions without explicit programming as well as how deep learning uses multi-layered neural networks to find patterns in complex data. The goal of generative AI is to create new content such as text, images and music whereas LLMs are a type of deep learnin algorithm that uses neural networks, specifically transformer networks, to process and understand. Additionally, I gained understanding of some prompt engineering techniques such as role conditioning, few shot examples, format devices and constraints.

  I engaged in a kahoot game to test my knowledge and understanding of generative AI. The guess the bot activity was also really fun where I got to collaborate with my time to detect and differentiate AI generated pictures from real pictures.

  There were no blockers. 
  
reflection: |
  The introduction to generative AI class was so insightful and informational which has deepened my understanding of AI and machine learning concepts. I have started familiarizing myself with more AI and machine learning concepts which I am eager to apply my knowledge to my project work for the summer. The conclusion of the python 101 class was a success, I have gained more confidence in my coding skills so far.
