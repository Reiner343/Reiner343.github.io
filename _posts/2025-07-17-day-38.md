what_i_learned: |
  Today’s research writing workshop gave me a solid structure for creating professional and effective research documents. I learned the value of using visual hierarchy, meaningful color schemes, and choosing the right templates and fonts to make content more readable. We discussed how multimodality can strengthen a presentation and why outlining your ideas early helps keep the message clear. I also learned to break my content down using headings like research gap, methodology, and findings. This came in handy when I started working on the introduction section of our smart water contamination project.
  
blockers: |
  Some parts of the introduction were hard to write without having complete data from the other sections. I had to pause and wait for team updates. 
  
reflection: |
  Writing the introduction helped me better understand the core goals of our project and how to frame them for impact. I was able to clearly communicate the problem we’re solving and why it matters, especially for underserved communities. Working with a structured outline made things flow more naturally. I also liked that our team split the work — it made the writing process more focused and efficient. I’m starting to feel more confident in translating technical ideas into clear research writing.
