what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on finalizing our presentation slides and learned how to communicate technical challenges in a way that’s clear and simple for any audience. I worked on structuring the challenges and solutions we faced during the project, like fixing our Firebase connection and setting up all sensors on one breadboard. I also learned how to choose the right visuals—like tables, line graphs, and pie charts—to help tell the story behind our data. Writing out the “Solutions and Adaptations” slide helped me better understand how each part of our system came together. And I now feel much more confident using Git and explaining how it supported both our website and data flow.

reflection: |
  Working on the final presentation made me realize how much I’ve grown throughout this project. What once felt overwhelming—like wiring sensors or debugging code—now feels like a challenge I can handle. Explaining our process forced me to really think about each step we took and how far we've come as a team. I’m proud of the technical skills I’ve built, but even more proud of how I’ve learned to organize and present them. Today reminded me that learning isn’t just about building something—it’s about being able to clearly share what you’ve built and why it matters.
