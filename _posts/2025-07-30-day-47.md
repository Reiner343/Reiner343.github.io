what_i_learned: |
  Today, I saw how data comes full circle from device collection to real-time dashboards. I worked on transforming raw Firebase values into clear visuals that showed trends in pH, turbidity, and TDS. I also learned how to interpret classification results like confusion matrices and how machine learning models like Random Forest and regression help us understand water safety better. On top of that, I improved the results section of our research paper by aligning our findings with the data visuals. It really showed me the importance of telling a story with data, not just collecting it.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Working on the results slide for our final presentation made everything feel more real. It’s one thing to build a system, but it’s another to clearly communicate what the system actually does. Seeing our charts and classification results side by side helped me feel more confident in our work. Today reminded me why I care so much about using tech for real-world problems like clean water. We’re not just building projects—we’re building solutions that matter.
