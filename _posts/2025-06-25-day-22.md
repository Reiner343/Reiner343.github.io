what_i_learned: |
  Today, I spent more time working on training my water quality model on Google Colab. I continued fine-tuning the code and paid closer attention to how the model learns from patterns in the dataset. Running the model, checking accuracy, and reviewing the output gave me a better understanding of how everything fits together. Later, we had a class session on deep learning, where I was introduced to concepts like neural networks, activation functions, and layers. It helped me understand how more complex models go beyond basic classification to handle larger-scale tasks. I’m still absorbing a lot of the information, but it was a solid introduction to how deep learning models are built and why they’re useful.

  I also learned how to interpret the results from my model and what those numbers actually mean in terms of how well the model is doing.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Today helped me see the bigger picture of machine learning and AI. Training my own model while also learning about deep learning made me appreciate the different levels of complexity that exist in this space. It also made me think about what our project could look like if we incorporated more advanced techniques down the line. I’m starting to feel more confident explaining what I’m doing to others, which is really encouraging.
