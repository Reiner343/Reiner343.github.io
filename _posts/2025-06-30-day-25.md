what_i_learned: |
  Today, I got a better understanding of how to review research articles in preparation for writing a research paper connected to our group project. It was interesting seeing how other projects were structured and how we might frame our own findings moving forward. I also worked with my team to put together and record our project video, which helped us practice how to communicate our work clearly. Later in the day, we started organizing our slides for next week’s mid-summer symposium presentation.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Today was all about refining how we present our work, both visually and verbally. Working on the research side helped me think more critically about the impact and structure of our project. Recording the video was a great way to practice simplifying our process, and building the symposium slides helped us think ahead about how to break down the project for a broader audience. I’m starting to feel more confident about speaking on different parts of the work we’ve done so far.
