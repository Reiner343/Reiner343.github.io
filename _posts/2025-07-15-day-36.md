what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on setting up the frontend part of our smart water monitoring project using React. I started by making sure the necessary tools were installed, like Node.js and npm, which are needed to run React applications. After that, I created a new React project and explored two setup options: the traditional approach and a faster one using a tool called Vite. I also added an icon library to help enhance the dashboard's interface. Once the setup was complete, I opened the project in my browser and began getting familiar with how React files are structured.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Working on the frontend gave me a better understanding of how all the data we’ve been collecting and processing will eventually be displayed to users. It’s one thing to analyze sensor readings, but presenting that information clearly is just as important. This part of the project helped me see how everything ties together—from the sensors and data models to the actual interface people will interact with. It also pushed me to think about design decisions like how best to represent water quality information. Today felt like a strong step toward making our system more user-friendly.
