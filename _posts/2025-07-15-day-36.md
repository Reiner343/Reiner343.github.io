what_i_learned: |
  Today, I had a cohort connect session where I learned how my detail-oriented personality helps me stay organized when working with tools like Firebase and React. I realized I’m good at breaking down complex problems, especially when setting up data flows or fixing bugs. Understanding how my learning style fits into the bigger picture gave me more confidence in my technical work. I also saw how I naturally step into testing roles because I like finding and solving issues. Being aware of these strengths is helping me approach my tasks with more focus and intention.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Today gave me a new perspective on how my personality plays a role in this project. I’m starting to see that the way I think and learn really supports the work I’ve been doing. I feel more comfortable taking initiative and helping with tasks that match my strengths. It also pushed me to think about ways I can stretch myself and grow. I’m looking forward to applying this self-awareness in our upcoming milestones.
