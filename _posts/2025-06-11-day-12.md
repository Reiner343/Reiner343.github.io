what_i_learned: |
  Today, I got a better understanding of how to program in Arduino and connect different types of sensors and modules to a breadboard. I explored how pH, turbidity, and TDS sensors work and how they each provide environmental data through simple wiring and code. I also learned about more advanced modules like GPS, GSM, and RFID readers, and how they can be combined with development boards like the ESP32 to build smart, connected systems. Seeing how these components can collect, transmit, and respond to real-world data really helped everything click. It’s exciting to see how much potential there is in combining these tools for impactful tech projects.

reflection: |
  At first, the variety of components felt a bit overwhelming, especially trying to keep track of what each module does and how it's wired. But watching the tutorials and going step-by-step made things clearer and more manageable. I’m starting to see how these small parts come together to form complex systems, and it’s honestly motivating. I’m still getting comfortable with the coding side, but I’m proud of how much progress I’ve made just by being curious and sticking with it.
