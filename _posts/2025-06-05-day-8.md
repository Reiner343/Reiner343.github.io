what_i_learned: |
  Today, I took a tour around Morgan's State campus along with other interns. Here, I learned some facts about morgan like the school is 150 years old, there are two engineering buildings in the school. Also, I learned that they just newly started their medical school and the building is currently being constructed. where I had to find quality water datasets for five different states in U.S. 
  
   Also, I also watched a youtube video where a sample system was built and tested out to check for safe water and possible contaminants found in the water.

blockers: |
  I encountered difficulties locating datasets for the five different states. However, I was introducted to he data.gov website where finding these datasets was made easier.

reflection: |
  The datasets found during my research helped me analyze and compare the various parameters across different states. The discussion had with my team about AI messing up our product helped us brain storming and challenge our critical thinking skills. This is really essential for potential problems that may arise when we start building our product. The youtube video gave me a better glance or view of the physical system that I will be building for my smart water project.
