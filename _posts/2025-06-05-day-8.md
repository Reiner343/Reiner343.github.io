what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on some dataset research, where I had to find quality water datasets for five different states in U.S. Of which, mine consisted of florida, alabama, missisipi, south carolina and georgia. Also, I and my project team engaged in a discussion talking about what would happen if AI messes up the final product of our smart water project. We came up with the potential problems being poorly designed interfaces or insufficient training. For solution, we came up with identifying the root cause by inputting more data, using the error for research, and improving the system. This is because the incorrect readings could result in unafe water being deemed safe. 
  
   Also, I also watched a youtube video where a sample system was built and tested out to check for safe water and possible contaminants found in the water.

  I encountered difficulties locating datasets for the five different states. However, I was introducted to he data.gov website where finding these datasets was made easier.

reflection: |
  The datasets found during my research helped me analyze and compare the various parameters across different states. The discussion had with my team about AI messing up our product helped us brain storming and challenge our critical thinking skills. This is really essential for potential problems that may arise when we start building our product. The youtube video gave me a better glance or view of the physical system that I will be building for my smart water project.
