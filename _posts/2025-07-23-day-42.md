what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to refine my elevator pitch by making it more clear, concise, and tailored to different audiences, which helped me better articulate the purpose of our project. We also spent time working on the Firebase Studio website, and I gained a deeper understanding of how data from our Arduino sensors flows into the Firebase Realtime Database and displays on the site. I explored how different parts of the frontend interact with the backend and how to improve the user experience. It was interesting to see how each feature we add makes the system more complete. Overall, I’m starting to feel more confident navigating both the technical and communication aspects of the project.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Working on our pitch made me realize how important it is to be able to explain what we’re building in a way that’s not only technically sound but also engaging and easy to follow. The Firebase website is really coming together, and it’s rewarding to see our hard work turning into something functional and visually appealing. At first, the setup was a bit confusing, but figuring things out along the way has made everything more meaningful. I'm proud of how much I've grown in both explaining my ideas and building them. Today was a reminder that learning by doing is the best way to grow.
