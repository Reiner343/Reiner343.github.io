what_i_learned: |
  Today, I created a Firebase account and started working on integrating it with my app. Firebase is really useful for handling things like user authentication and syncing real-time data, which will be a big part of how our system runs. I also worked with the ESP32 microcontroller and began wiring components together on a physical breadboard. It was interesting to move away from the digital simulations in TinkerCad and actually connect the sensors and devices ourselves. Doing it hands-on gave me a better understanding of how everything fits together and what we’ll need to adjust as we keep building.

  Setting up Firebase took a little time to figure out. Understanding how to properly connect it with the app required a bit of troubleshooting and research.
  
reflection: |
  Working with the physical hardware today helped me see how our project is starting to take shape. Setting up the breadboard and ESP32 showed me how each piece plays a role in the bigger system, and it was helpful to start making those real-world connections. It also reminded me that combining software and hardware takes a lot of small, careful steps. I’m looking forward to continuing that process and seeing how we can make everything work smoothly together.
