what_i_learned: |
  Today, I got to meet and learn more about my faculty mentor and my graduate mentor as well dive deeper into my project. The smart water project is centered around using AI and machine learning tools to develop a machine to reduce the water contamination in maryland. For this week, my teammates and I were told to conduct a literature review on IoT and AI in waste management. Additionally, I started working on the about me and blog pages for my website. Here, I learned how to make changes and edits to my website through my git repository. Also, I attended the python 101 class where I learned the basic conccepts of python and some takeaways from this class include python terms such as concatenation, strings, data types, integer, float, PEMDAS. During this class, we played a kahoot game which was super refreshing because it served as a retainer of all my python knowledge learned during the class session. 

   Also, I together with the other interns engaged in a fun activity called headbandz which helped relieve the pressure from the tedious work done earlier.

  The commmit changes made to my code kept on failing to update. However, the changes that were being made kept reflecting on my website which counted as a win for me.

reflection: |
  The kick-off for my project was a success. I got to learn and dive deeper into the activities and tasks that will be performed during the program. Seeing my commit changes keep on failing to update was a bit dissapointing and nerve-wracking, but I was able to keep pushing and trying over again until I started seeing positive results on my website. I am looking forward to diving deeper into advanced python and learning much more about the programming language.
