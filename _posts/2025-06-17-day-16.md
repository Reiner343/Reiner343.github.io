what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned how to train a decision tree model to predict house prices using a real dataset from Iowa. I practiced reading data with pandas, selecting important features like lot size and number of rooms, and splitting everything into training and validation sets. Then I used the model to make predictions and check how close they were to the actual sale prices. It felt good to build something from scratch and see how all the small steps connect to the bigger picture.
  
   I also got a better feel for how machine learning models “think” by learning from patterns in data, which made the whole process way more interesting.
   
blockers: |
  I ran into a few errors, mostly from forgetting small but important things — like calling .fit() without referencing the model, or skipping setup cells that needed to run first. 

reflection: |
  Working through this project made machine learning feel a lot more approachable than I expected. It reminded me that even complex topics can be learned step by step with patience and curiosity. Each bug or error I fixed felt like a mini win that built my confidence. I’m starting to see how I could use these skills to solve real problems in the future.
