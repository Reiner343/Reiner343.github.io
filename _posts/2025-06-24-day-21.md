what_i_learned: |
  Today was a great mix of planning, coding, and hands-on testing. During our cohort connect, we discussed final preparations for our upcoming symposium presentation on Friday. That conversation helped me start thinking critically about how to communicate both the technical and problem-solving aspects of our project in a clear, engaging way. After that, I dove deeper into our dataset — not just running the training code, but really focusing on what each line means. I’ve been trying to structure everything in a way that makes sense to someone who may not be familiar with machine learning or Arduino. I practiced breaking down concepts like model training, feature selection, and label encoding, all in a way I could easily explain out loud. It was really helpful for my own understanding, too. I also worked on making sure the visuals and code outputs will be easy to show during our presentation.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  One of the most exciting parts of today was the continued testing of our physical components. We got to work directly with the breadboard, ESP32, and various sensors, which we’ve mostly only seen in simulations so far. Actually wiring them up and seeing how the system behaves in real time was such a rewarding shift — it gave a whole new sense of realism to our project. We’re also starting to map out who will present what section on Friday, and I’m feeling more confident as we move forward.
