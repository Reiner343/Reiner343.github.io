what_i_learned: |
  Today, I spent time connecting our ESP32 sensor system to Firebase so we can view our water quality readings in real time. I created a Firebase project, set up the Realtime Database, and figured out how to configure the rules and credentials so everything could communicate properly. After updating the ESP32 code with our WiFi and Firebase details, I uploaded it and watched our sensor data—pH, turbidity, and TDS—show up live in the database. It was really cool to see the data being sent successfully, and it helped me understand how cloud platforms can support real-world projects.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Seeing everything come together today gave me a better picture of how all the parts of our system—hardware, code, and the cloud—connect. It’s nice watching the project evolve from simulations to something that’s now live and functional. I’m starting to feel more confident about explaining how everything works during our upcoming presentation. It also made me excited to explore how we can visualize this data in dashboards for easier monitoring and decision-making.
