what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on the kpresentation slides for our upcoming mid-summer showcase. I was in charge of the project summary slide, so I had to clearly explain what our smart water quality monitoring system is all about—why it matters, how it works, and what impact we’re aiming for. I also worked on my personal slide where I reflected on my role in the project, the challenges I’ve faced, and the progress I’ve made so far. In between that, I joined my group in continuing the hands-on testing of the ESP32 with our sensors. Running the Arduino code again and seeing how each component responds in real time really helped reinforce how everything fits together.

reflection: |
  It felt good to step back and see how far we've come as a team. Writing about my contributions helped me realize just how much I've learned—from setting up hardware to understanding how data flows through our system. Working on the slides also reminded me how important communication is, especially when trying to explain something technical in a way everyone can understand. It also made me think more intentionally about how to present both the technical and human sides of the project in a way that connects with our audience.
