what_i_learned: |
  Today, I had the in-person kick-off where all the interns, faculty and graduate mentors introduced themselves in the auditorium. Here, Michael also gave an in-depth overview of the summer program with all the necessary information included. After which, I participated in a workshop with Mrs. Walters where we discussed independent and dependent variable mainly focusing on how to formulate ypur research and train data. Also, we took group pictures in the lobby of the auditorium. After this, I participated in a very fun group activity with my project team where we built a structure with spaghetti sticks and marshmallow. Next up, I had lunch with my project team. Lastly, I and my project team took a tour of our research labs and the building as a whole. 

  This helped me better understand how attention levels fluctuate, especially when switching between tasks. I also learned how to calculate moving averages to reduce noise in the signal while preserving response time.

  The biggest challenge was maintaining a stable Bluetooth connection. The signal would occasionally drop for a second or two, which disrupted the live charting. I plan to explore buffering strategies next. Additionally, I still see low-frequency artifacts from head movement.

reflection: |
  Watching my brainwaves animate in real time felt surreal. It made all the previous setup work worth it. Next, I’ll begin connecting this live data stream to robotic behaviors in NeuroLink Assist—starting with simple directional movement based on concentration strength.
