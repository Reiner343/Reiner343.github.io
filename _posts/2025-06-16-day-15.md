what_i_learned: |
  Today I and my team focused on finalizing our project slides for the project video presentation. As I went over my accomplishments for the week, I realized how much progress I’ve made, especially in learning how to wire and code sensors like pH, turbidity, and temperature in TinkerCad and Arduino. I also learned how to interpret sensor readings and apply logic in code to control physical components like fans and heaters. Additionally, I started an introduction to machine learning class on Kaggle, which gave me new insights into how AI could enhance projects like ours.
  
   It was really cool to get a first look at the kind of materials we might be working with for the actual implementation phase.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a great wrap-up to everything we’ve learned this week. Putting together the slides made me realize how much technical ground we’ve covered in such a short time. It also gave me the chance to think about how each part of the project fits into the bigger picture. Seeing the sample materials and starting the machine learning class got me excited about what’s coming next, I feel more prepared to keep building on what we've started.
