what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the beginning of my work on computer vision, google colab as well as continued learning of python 101. I learned the four basic tasks of computer vision which includes image classification, object detection, object tracking and image segmentation. Also, I learned exactly how computer vision works and was able to test/experiment using teachable machine to train my model. After which, I transitioned into installing ultralytics on google colab which was used in addition to yolo v8 functions for object detection. I familiarized myself with different yolo models such as yolov8n.pt and yolov8x.pt. Also, I engaged in a very fun escape room activity with my project team where we cracked the code to escape the room after multiple tries.

  I also started exploring how to use Python to create a digital profile with variables on replit. Here, I performed various examples of variables as well learning how to create an I/O cycle.

  Today, there were no blockers.

reflection: |
  It was exciting to use teachable machine to train my model. Seeing how teachable machine detects and predicts the objects was very insightful and fun. Also, the activities that we carried out on python helped challenged my skills and brain capacity. I'm especially curious to learn much more about other concepts in python.
