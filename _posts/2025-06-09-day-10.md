what_i_learned: |
  Today was really productive and gave me a clearer view of where our project is headed. Working with my team on the video slides helped me see how all the pieces, like our goals, accomplishments, and even challenges, fit together. I realized how important it is to not just collect data, but to actually understand what it means and how it connects to the bigger picture. I also learned more about the tools we’ll be using, like the ESP32 and different water sensors, which honestly made the project feel more real and exciting. 
  
   Overall, I’m learning to balance the research side with the hands-on tech side, and it’s starting to click.

  My team and I had some issues recording our video presentation but after multiple tries, we finally got it to work and earned our final product.

reflection: |
  Looking back, I’m proud of how much progress we’ve made so far, even with some of the challenges. Preparing the presentation made me realize how important it is to slow down and really think through each step of the project. It’s easy to get caught up in just completing tasks, but reflecting on our goals and methods helped me understand the "why" behind what we’re doing. I also saw how teamwork plays a huge role, everyone brings a different perspective, and that makes our project stronger.
