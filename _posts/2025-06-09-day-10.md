what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to connect components like sensors, relays, and an LCD screen using a breadboard and Arduino in TinkerCad. I explored how a temperature sensor can trigger actions like turning on a fan or heater, which helped me understand how automation works in real life. I also followed a demo on creating a water level indicator, which showed me how sensors can give real-time feedback based on environmental changes. Playing around with the circuits really helped me visualize how each part works together. 
  
   I also started recognizing how these basic components can be used to solve real-world problems through simple but smart automation.

  No blockers were encountered today. 

reflection: |
  At first, it felt a bit overwhelming trying to follow along with the wiring and code, especially since some concepts were totally new to me. But once I got into TinkerCad and started testing things out, it became easier to connect the dots. It was honestly exciting to see the sensors react and trigger responses—it made the learning feel more hands-on. I’m definitely more confident now about using Arduino, and I’m curious to try building something of my own soon.
