what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on setting up the ESP32 development board and connecting it to the Arduino IDE to begin testing pH levels. After installing the ESP32 board package, I worked through the initial setup to start capturing sensor data using a pH 7 buffer solution. On the hardware side, I wired everything together—using the ESP32, jumper wires, an adapter, and the DFRobot Gravity Analog pH Sensor Meter Kit V2 (SEN0161-V2). The goal was to stream live pH readings to the Serial Monitor and observe the sensor’s response.

  This gave me a better understanding of how sensors communicate through microcontrollers and how the Arduino environment receives and interprets that data. Even though there were a few hiccups, it was a solid hands-on session in building, connecting, and debugging hardware.

  One of the main issues I ran into was that the ESP32 wouldn’t upload code successfully. Every attempt to flash the board returned connection errors. 
  
reflection: |
  Today was a mix of progress and patience. Setting up the hardware and getting everything connected felt like a good step forward, but running into upload errors and sensor issues reminded me how unpredictable working with hardware can be. Still, I walked away with a better understanding of wiring, microcontroller communication, and sensor calibration—even if everything didn’t work perfectly. These kinds of troubleshooting days are part of the process, and I’m ready to keep pushing forward to get more accurate readings soon.
