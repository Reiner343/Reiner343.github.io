what_i_learned: |
  I learned how brain-computer interfaces work and how they can be used to control machines like drones using just cognitive commands. It showed me how powerful neural signals are when combined with tech. I also deepened my understanding of integrating Arduino with Firebase to send and store real-time sensor data. Debugging the connection helped me understand the importance of data structure and proper calibration. These skills are essential for building smart, connected systems.
  
blockers: |
  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Today really opened my eyes to how far technology can go when we blend it with human cognition. The workshop made me think about the future of accessibility and how people with disabilities could benefit from mind-controlled devices. Working on our Arduino-to-Firebase setup also reminded me how satisfying it is to solve real-world challenges through code. I feel like I’m building something that actually matters. Each day, it’s becoming clearer how this research connects to my purpose.
