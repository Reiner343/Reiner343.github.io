what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to calibrate our sensor data so that it accurately reflects ground truth values, which is an essential step in making sure our system is reliable and meaningful. I also began helping with our final presentation slides, thinking through how to clearly communicate our research process, results, and overall impact. Another big focus was troubleshooting our Arduino code—I worked on getting it to properly send our readings to Firebase for real-time storage. It helped me better understand how the ESP32 and Firebase communicate and where errors can occur. Each part of today’s work built on what we’ve learned so far, bringing everything together.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Working on sensor calibration really showed me how small adjustments can make a big difference in the accuracy of our data. It felt rewarding to connect our hands-on coding with the big-picture goals of our research. Even though fixing the Firebase connection wasn’t easy, it reminded me how much I’ve grown in debugging and problem-solving. Starting the final presentation made everything feel real—we’re nearing the end, and I’m proud of what we’ve built. Today reminded me that every little detail matters when building something that’s meant to make an impact.
