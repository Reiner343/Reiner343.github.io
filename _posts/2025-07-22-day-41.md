what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned how to connect our Arduino (with the ESP32) to Firebase and send real-time sensor data to the Realtime Database. I explored how to set up the Firebase project, configure the credentials, and write code that pushes data from the sensors into the cloud. It was a good mix of hardware and backend work. I also figured out how to debug common connection issues like Wi-Fi errors or failed uploads. On top of that, I spent time improving the flow of our research paper, making sure the technical process is clearly explained.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Connecting Firebase to Arduino felt like a huge step forward because it brought everything together—from the physical sensors to cloud storage. Seeing the data show up live reminded me of why I enjoy hands-on tech projects. It helped me understand how cloud-based systems work in real-world IoT applications. Writing the paper right after helped reinforce what I had just built, which made the explanations feel more genuine. Overall, it was a productive and satisfying day.
