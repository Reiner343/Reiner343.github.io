what_i_learned: |
  Today, I spent most of my time finalizing our slides and preparing for the demo video. I got more confident breaking down how the machine learning model works and how we used the cleaned water dataset to train it. Going through the Firebase part again helped me better explain how sensor data is being stored and displayed. I also picked up some small tips on how to communicate technical stuff without overcomplicating it. Working on the video really made me focus on what actually matters when showing our progress.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Working on the demo video made me realize how much we’ve actually done so far. It pushed me to simplify complex parts of our project so others can follow along. I also saw where I still needed to clarify some things, especially in the way I explain the ML process. Collaborating with my teammates helped us smooth out any gaps and make the video flow better. Overall, it was a productive day of pulling everything together.
