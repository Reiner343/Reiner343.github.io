what_i_learned: |
  Today I got to meet my project team and we shared various insights amongst ourselves as well getting to know each other on a more personal level. I also familarized myself with Git and Github concepts and refreshed my memory of past knowledge. After which, I took a placement test on the basic concepts of python to enable my supervisors/mentors knw where I stand in python. I also did a virtual speed networking bingo which helped me learn more about other interns in the program.

  I also started exploring ways I could make changes to my personal website through my github repository. 

blockers: |
  Ny URL website link failed to work because I previously had a personal website with my exact username which affected the creation of my new website.

reflection: |
  It was exciting to finally meet and get to know my team members. The placement test was able to test my knowledge on the basic concepts in python, of which I still have a lot to learn. However, I am really excited to expand my python knowledge as well as dive into understanding the concepts of other various programming languages.
