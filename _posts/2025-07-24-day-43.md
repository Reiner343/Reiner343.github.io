what_i_learned: |
  This morning’s workshop was all about structuring our research paper using Overleaf. I learned how to properly format sections like the abstract, introduction, methodology, and references using LaTeX, which is something I hadn’t used in-depth before. It helped me understand how formatting contributes to the overall clarity and professionalism of a research paper. After the workshop, I focused on writing the introduction section for our paper. It challenged me to clearly summarize our project, explain its relevance, and connect it to broader issues like community impact and environmental concerns.

  There were no blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Using Overleaf pushed me to be more mindful about structure and consistency. Writing the introduction also helped me better define our project’s goals and the importance of our work in addressing water contamination. I realized that strong research writing isn’t just about reporting result,it’s about telling a clear, logical story. It felt rewarding to see our work come together in a more formal format. Overall, today gave me more confidence in both my technical writing and collaborative research skills.
