what_i_learned: |
  While working briefly on our project video today, I saw how a clear storyline makes even technical content more engaging. But most of my time was spent refining our research paper, especially focusing on structure and flow. I learned how important it is for each section to transition smoothly—how the introduction should naturally lead into the methodology, and how the findings should clearly support our objectives. I also practiced tightening my writing so everything reads clean without losing meaning. It's helping me become a lot more intentional about how I present ideas.

reflection: |
  Working on the paper today really made me appreciate the importance of structure in technical writing. It's easy to get lost in details if there’s no clear order, so outlining before writing has been a game changer. I’m starting to see how each part of the paper works like a puzzle piece. Even though it’s challenging, I like seeing how everything we’ve done fits together. It’s giving me a better grasp of how to explain tech projects in a professional way.
