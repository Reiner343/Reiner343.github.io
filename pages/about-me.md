  bio: |
    I‚Äôm currently a rising junior studying Computer and Information at Edward Waters University in Jacksonville, Florida. I expect to graduate in 2027.

    My work explores the understanding of the science behind water contamination as well as applying AI techniques to design and prototype a smart detection system to curb it. 

    When I‚Äôm not working on research, I enjoy traveling, listening to music, online shopping, trying out fine dining restauarnts and hanging out with my friends in my free time.
