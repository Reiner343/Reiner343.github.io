subtitle: Water Contamination & AI
project_title: "Smart Water Contamination Detection Using AI Model"

problem: |
  Individuals face significant health risks due to contaminated water which may come from sources such as industrial runoff, griculture and sewage with common contaminants present in them such as lead, E.coli and nitrates. 

  This project focuses on addressing the critical public health need for safe and clean drinking water by developing an AI driven system to predict lead, heavy metals and microbial pathogens that poses significant health risks.
  
approach: |
  The project follows a four-phase pipeline:

  - Analyze collected data with AI models, and contribute to optimizing contamination detection algorithms for accurate prediction
  - Develop a real time water quality monitoring system using sensors
  - Deploying AI models on cloud/edge devices via AWS IoT
  - The system will integrate IoT enabled water sensors to measure critical parameters such as pH levels, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and heavy metal presence.

  Open-source tools such as Google Colab, Python, AI frameworks (TensorFlow and Scikit-leam), and AWS Sagemaker will be used to prototype the system.

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result in a the development of a smart AI-driven water quality monitoring that leverages real- time sensor data, machine learning algorithms, and predictive analytics to detect and forecast contamination risks. The system will be designed for scalability and deployment in diverse environments, including urban water distribution networks, rural water sources and industrial discharge monitoring.
